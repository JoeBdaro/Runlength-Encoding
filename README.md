# Runlength-Encoding
C++ Implementation of the Runlength Encoding compression algorithm 

C++ Implementation of the Runlength Decoding compression algorithm

This is the encoding algorithm for the (with zero and no wrap-around) and the (no zero and wrap-around) methods of run length encoding. Given a file, the algorithm will encode the file using either method 1 or method 2  as specified by the user. After encoding the file the algorithm will then generate a file called "X_encodeMethodY" where X is the original input file name and Y is the encoding method used

<b>How to run</b>

This code runs from the command line and requires the following arguments from command line upon running

argv[1]: inFile or image provided text document

argv[2]: which method 1 or 4 would you like to encode the file in
